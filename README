This is the beginning of a module for use under CGI:: to sniff out what
browser someone's really using, despite the fact that it claims to be
"Mozilla" (can you say Micro$oft?).

If you can provide me with User Agent values that call themselves 
"Mozilla", I'd appreciate it, and I'll add it.  Right now, I've got:

Any real version of Netscape Navigator
Any version of Netscape Communicator
Any version of MS Internet Explorer 2.0 or higher.

To install this module, you need to:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

I've already made HTML documentation from tne embedded POD. It's in the doc/
directory.

What's new?

Version 0.07
------------

* Added support for Opera, another browser claiming to be Mozilla.
* Experimenting with some different regexp techniques.  They seem to be
  working out, I think I'll convert the rest to this style later.

Version 0.06
------------

It's all new!  This was the first public release.
