This is the beginning of a module for use under CGI:: to sniff out what
browser someone's really using, despite the fact that it claims to be
"Mozilla" (can you say Micro$oft?).

If you can provide me with User Agent values that call themselves 
"Mozilla", I'd appreciate it, and I'll add it.  Right now, I've got:

Any real version of Netscape Navigator
Any version of Netscape Communicator
Any version of MS Internet Explorer 2.0 or higher.

To install this module, you need to:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

I've already made HTML documentation from tne embedded POD. It's in the doc/
directory.
